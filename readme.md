# Multi-Target Tracking with Radar

This repository contains the code for the term project **"Probabilistic Filtering Techniques for Multi-Target Tracking in Radar Systems"**, completed for **KOM505E Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes** at Istanbul Technical University (Fall 2024).

## Overview

The project focuses on:
- Tracking multiple targets using radar systems.
- Addressing challenges like measurement association, false alarms, and nonlinearities in radar data.
- Implementing filters like EKF, UKF, IMM, and PF for robust tracking.

## Access

The code is available on this repository until **3rd February 2024**.
